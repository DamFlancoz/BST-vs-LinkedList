# BST-vs-LinkedList
Compared insertion and access times of Binary Search Tree and Linked List. Verified theoretical time complexities. Completed as part of CSC 115 (Fundamentals of Programming II) coursework. This allowed us to implement a BST and using given Linked List experiment with different sizes of both. A good difference number of iterations (steps) was observed. Results in performance.txt file.

# Concepts
- Understanding of Binary Search Tree and its implementation
- Understanding of time complexities of linked list and bst.
- Reading and building upon existing Java code.
